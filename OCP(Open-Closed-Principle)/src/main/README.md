This principle states: “software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed 
for modification “. Let’s zero in on the two key phrases of the statement:

1.“Open for extension “: This means that the behavior of a software module, say a class can be extended to make it behave 
in new and different ways. It is important to note here that the term “extended ” is not limited to inheritance using 
the Java extend keyword. As mentioned earlier, Java did not exist at that time. What it means here is that a module 
should provide extension points to alter its behavior. One way is to make use of polymorphism to invoke extended 
behaviors of an object at run time.

2.“Closed for modification “: This means that the source code of such a module remains unchanged.
